This directory has the documentation and instructions for the
bottom-up decarbonization policy-analysis lab (lab #9) and a template
for your lab report.

The file `bottom_up_analysis_project.Rmd` is a template for your 
lab report. You should edit it to make your lab report:

* In the "Data and Methods" section, put your R code chunks to
  analyze the Kaya-identity data for the countries and regions
  you are analyzing.
  
    When you write up your lab report, you should include text describing
    what you were doing in the analysis (e.g., what did the different
    R code chunks do, and why?)
    
* In the "Results and Discussion" section, discuss what you found and include
  R code chunks for presenting tables or graphs if that is relevant.
  
* In the Introduction section, write a short introduction explaining what
  this lab was about and what its relevance is.

* In the Conclusions section, write a short conclusion about what the results
  of your analysis mean for the prospects of getting the world onto the RCP 2.6
  emissions pathway.

For this report, it is not necessary to include citations and bibliography
unless you want to.
